Leads Website

This is simple demonstration of a .Net 6.0 website using a mongodb database as a persistent data storage. It is merely a demonstration, and designed to be run on a windows PC with a local mongodb database, with no guarantees for portability to a typical web server environment. It is incomplete, and updates as well as a proper readme will be coming soon.
